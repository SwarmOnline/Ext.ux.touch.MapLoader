# Ext.ux.touch.MapLoader

This plugin allows you to have your map dynamically load points of interest as the user pans around the map allowing you to minimize the amount of data you have to fetch from the server and 
minimize the number of markers on the map speeding up performance by only dealing with points that are within the map's visible area.
